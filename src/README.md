# mindGymLab Website
This is the code for mindGymLab based out of Bejing China. They are the first and only neurocognitive training center in China, looking to 
reach a broader audience through the web. This code is the complete markup of the website published for mindGymLab.

mindGymLab wanted a custom code solution so they could host there website on a server that reaches their current market.

Something to note about this code--it was built with vanilla javascript, html and css. For bundling the files, Webpack was used. It is a single page application that dynamically renders the content when "different pages" are interacted with.
